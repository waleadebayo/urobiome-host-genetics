# urobiome-host-genetics
A compilation of scripts used for analyses in Adebayo et al(..doi). 

Essentialy includes various microbiome and host genetics analyses in R and few python-based and bash scripts 
as well as microbiome and cognitive/ageing-related analyses in Adebayo et al(doi...) 

Sequence data used are available from ENA (accession number) and participant data (managed access) from TwinsUK <twinsuk.ac.uk>

All scripts utilise packages available from CRAN, Bioconductor, github, biobakery,or QIIME2

Scripts are arranged to match figure arrangement in the cited paper

1. Comparison of microbiome at different sites and in paired urine/gut samples (link to page)

2. Significant Influence of host genetics on urine microbes (link to page)

3. Average contribution of factors [here](https://github.com/waleadebayo/urobiome-host-genetics/blob/Average-contribution-of-factors/contribution%20to%20variance)
